# attacks types

## Power Analysis

* Recorded power consumption of a target can be used to determine information leaked by the device. 
* leaked information can often be used to recover the encryption key during encryption or other sensitive information 

## Fault

* glitching the target Using voltage, and clock glitching 
* cause the target to perform unintended operations or skip operations, 
* exposing the secret
* bypassing authentication 
* bypassing the ends of buffers to dump SRAM
